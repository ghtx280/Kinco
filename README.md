### If you are a movie buff and like to keep a list of the movies you have watched, this program will be useful to you. In it, you can not only record the title, but also add the year, genre and note to the film. You can mark a movie as a favorite and notice whether you watched it or want to watch it. There is a sort function settings, changing the theme (b/w), and you can also turn off the animations as you wish.
